## Just wait and see...
## It doesn’t matter when you start; what matters is whether you start at all.
## Do you know? The biggest risk in life is not taking any risk. Take risks to achieve something great — dream big, achieve big.
## Never go with the flow; be the flow.
## Do you know what real peace of mind is? It’s  comparing your failures with the success of others. 🤣🤣
